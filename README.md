🔬 **Project: Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) Analysis Using Machine Learning**
📊 **Domain:** Healthcare | Predictive Analytics | Data Science

In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis and prediction of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) using advanced **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and both **supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques**.

### 🧪 Key Preprocessing Steps:

* ✅ Removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity
* 🧼 Handled missing and incorrect values:

  * Replaced 0 values in ‘serumcholestrol’ with NaN and imputed using the **median**
* 🔤 Converted categorical numeric codes into meaningful labels for better interpretation
* 📉 Detected and removed **outliers using the IQR method**, ensuring data consistency
* 📊 Performed **feature selection** by removing highly correlated features
* ⚖️ Applied **Min-Max Scaling** for numerical normalization
* 🔁 Encoded categorical variables to ensure **machine learning compatibility**

### 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Visualized **feature distributions**
* Analyzed **feature importance** to identify key indicators of CVD

### 🤖 Classification Models Used:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree
* k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Random Forest

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning:

* Performed **K-Means Clustering** to uncover hidden patterns and patient groupings

### 📈 Outcome:

Built multiple models to predict cardiovascular disease likelihood and explored unsupervised techniques to segment patient profiles based on clinical features. This project demonstrated how **machine learning can support early diagnosis and risk assessment in healthcare.**
